<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# Support Ticketing System Web Application 
## About The Project


This project was created to solve a problem at my current job. As the financial systems manager I have to keep track of issues our employees are having with our software systems and see that they are resolved. Currently we are tracking these issues in an excel spreadsheet. This project is a full stack web application that will replace that spreadsheet. Company employees are able to create an account and/or log in and submit new issues/tickets. These tickets and their status can be seen by everyone in a dashboard. There is also a detail page where both all employees and suport team memebers can leave comments about the issue and status of the resolution.
